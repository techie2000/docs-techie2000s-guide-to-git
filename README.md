# docs-techie2000s-guide-to-git
Gathering my mental notes on git.

This is very much a WIP project, and intended for my use only. I suggest that if you stumble upon it that you do NOT fork/clone it - my thoughts/musings are not likely to be the same as yours ;)

The plane (for now at least) is that most things will be in the [wiki](../../wiki).
